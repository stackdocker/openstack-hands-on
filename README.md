### Nov-10-2015 UTC+8, Lab of migrating Cinder LVM-Drived Volumes

Background: I have a OpenStack Icehouse version in my laptop running 2 yrs. At first it use /dev/loop to simulate a LVM device for cinder, and this limited my using as I have no more disk size to run new VM. So I decide migrate these to a external hard disk and succeess to complete, but my new trouble is this legacy hard disk need power and hard to bring with. It is the 2nd time to migrate volumes into a new portable hard disk.
